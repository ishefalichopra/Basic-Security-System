# Basic-Security-System
This program is a basic security system with the following functionalities:

Register: Allows the user to register with a username, password, and age. The registration details are stored in a file named "file.txt".
Login: Asks the user to enter their username and password, which are verified by reading the "file.txt" file. If the credentials are correct, the user details are displayed.
Change Password: Allows the user to change their password by verifying their old password. The new password is then updated in the "file.txt" file.
End Program: Ends the program execution.
The program uses file handling to store and retrieve user information from the "file.txt" file. The user interface is presented in the console and the user inputs are taken using standard input (cin). The program uses string variables to store user input and data read from the file.
